//! Helper for `tests/pid_namespace_test.rs`. Opens a database and either dies
//! holding the lock, or reports whether the open succeeded.
//!
//! An example rather than a test so it is a standalone binary the test can run
//! under `unshare`.
//!
//! # Why the release marker is an argument, not an environment variable
//!
//! It was an environment variable first, and that silently did nothing on CI.
//! GitHub's runners restrict unprivileged user namespaces, so the test falls
//! back to `sudo unshare ...`, and sudo defaults to `env_reset`: everything
//! outside a small allowlist is stripped before the command runs. The holder
//! therefore saw no marker, took the "nothing to wait for" path, and aborted
//! the instant it had the lock -- so the second container found the file free
//! and opened it, and the test reported that a live holder had not been
//! excluded, when in truth there had been no live holder to exclude.
//! Arguments cross that boundary; environment variables do not.
//!
//! # Why this kills itself
//!
//! The obvious design is for the test to spawn a holder and kill it. That does
//! not survive contact with CI. GitHub's runners restrict unprivileged user
//! namespaces, so the test falls back to `sudo unshare ...`, and Ubuntu's sudo
//! defaults to `use_pty`, which runs the command in a NEW SESSION. Signalling
//! the process we spawned then reaches only `sudo` itself — SIGKILL runs no
//! handler, so nothing is forwarded — and killing the process group misses the
//! holder too, because it is no longer in that group. The holder survives,
//! still holding the flock, and the #317 regression test fails identically
//! whether or not the bug is present.
//!
//! So the holder ends its own life instead. `abort()` is the right instrument:
//! it terminates without unwinding and without running any `Drop`, which is
//! precisely what a SIGKILLed container leaves behind — no checkpoint, no lock
//! release by the library, nothing but whatever the kernel does on its own.
//! That is the exact state #317 is about.
