# Minigraf Benchmarks

This document records reproducible local benchmark snapshots. Completed release-performance history belongs in the [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md); continuous CI history is available on [Bencher](https://bencher.dev/perf/minigraf/plots).

## Current Local Snapshot

**Version**: v2.0.0

**Date**: 2026-08-26

**Command**: `cargo bench -- 'query/(point_entity|point_attribute|join_3pattern)'`

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| CPU | Intel Core i7-1065G7 @ 1.30 GHz (4 cores / 8 threads) |
| OS | Manjaro Linux 6.12.101-1 |
| Rust | 1.94.0 |
| Benchmark framework | Criterion 0.8 |
| Profile | `bench` (optimized) |

### Query Latency

Each value is Criterion's estimated per-query latency; the range is its 95% confidence interval. The current query fixture covers 1K and 10K facts.

| Benchmark | 1K facts | 10K facts |
|---|---:|---:|
| `point_entity` (bound entity + attribute) | 6.05 µs (5.91–6.25) | 5.88 µs (5.86–5.89) |
| `point_attribute` (bound attribute) | 2.12 ms (2.11–2.14) | 26.09 ms (25.68–26.34) |
| `join_3pattern` (three-clause join) | 5.94 ms (5.90–6.00) | 75.88 ms (71.22–82.39) |

`point_entity` uses a selective index-backed lookup. `point_attribute` and `join_3pattern` return larger result sets and therefore scale with the number of matching facts. Do not compare these local measurements directly with CI runs or earlier releases: host load, CPU-frequency policy, toolchain, and implementation all affect the result.

## Measurement Method

Criterion warms up each benchmark, collects ten samples for this query group, and estimates per-call latency from repeated iterations. The reported confidence intervals describe measurement uncertainty on this host; they are not cross-machine performance guarantees.

For changes that may affect performance, record the exact command, version, toolchain, host characteristics, and fixture size alongside the result. Use the Bencher history for trend and regression analysis across CI runs.

## Reproducing

```bash
# Run the current documented query snapshot.
cargo bench -- 'query/(point_entity|point_attribute|join_3pattern)'

# Run every Criterion benchmark (the full suite includes slow large-fixture cases).
cargo bench

# Run an individual group.
cargo bench -- 'insert'
cargo bench -- 'concurrent_btree_scan'
```

Criterion writes HTML reports to `target/criterion/`. A benchmark result should be refreshed after changes to the query, storage, synchronization, or compiler/toolchain paths it exercises.

## Scope and Caveats

- Results are measurements, not service-level guarantees.
- The full suite intentionally includes expensive large-fixture and quadratic workloads; run focused groups during development and the complete suite for a release-level performance review.
- Heap and RSS measurements require a separate profiler run and are not included in this snapshot.
