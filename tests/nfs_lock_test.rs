//! #324: kernel file locking must behave correctly on network filesystems.
//!
//! `flock` over NFS is emulated by `fcntl` on Linux since 2.6.37, which works
//! on NFSv4 but needs `lockd` on NFSv3. The failure mode that matters is a
//! lock that silently no-ops rather than erroring: the new code would believe
//! it holds an exclusive lock while a second process holds the same file.
//!
//! The NFS-mount tests below need a loopback NFS export, which needs root and
//! is provisioned by `.github/workflows/nfs-lock.yml`, not by this file. They
//! skip cleanly when the environment variables they need are unset, so plain
//! `cargo test` never touches them.
//!
//! `MINIGRAF_NFS_TEST_DIR_V3_NOLOCK` is intentionally not set by that
//! workflow (#334): the `nolock` mount option is a documented-unsupported
//! deployment (docs/ERROR_REFERENCE.md STG-027), not a case CI gates on.
//! The three tests gated on it below are kept for local reproduction against
//! a manually mounted `-o nolock` export; nightly CI always skips them.
